If you're like most normal people, you'll need some time to digest all the
information just thrown at you. The commands we just covered are literally the
only ones I used for the first few weeks learning Vim. If you're just starting
out I would encourage you to stick to these for now, and maybe give them a test
drive on the code examples I've provided (python, latex, java).  Or maybe do
":wq" and start something brand-new.  In case you hadn't noticed, there are some
helpful links towards the bottom that open up various panels for you to
reference as you learn.

Below is a table summarizing what has been covered.  There is, however, ONE more
really useful thing I think you should know about before we call it a day, and
that is search and replace.  It's used all the time by everyone so it's a good
one to know about.  When you're ready, type ":o sixth.html" and hit ENTER.

 Key   | Action         | How you'll remember this

       |                | 
 i     | Enter Insert   | "i" stands for "Insert"
       |                | 
 [ESC] | Enter Normal   | Escape from wherever you are, go back to the mode
       |                | where everything makes sense and life is easy: Normal
       |                | mode.
       |                | 
 :     | Enter Execute  | Twoface, coin flipping, just wanting what's fair.
       |                | 
 :wq   | Save and quit  | "write" and "quit"
       |                | 
 :q!   | Quit no save   |  I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING (YOU'RE YELLING), JUST QUIT!
       |                |
