Assuming you're a newbie, Vim is very much unlike any editor you've used before.
It looks familiar enough, but as soon as you try typing anything, weird stuff
happens. Type 'Andrew' and you'll see what I mean (no really, try it).
 
Here you have two choices, a sort of red pill, blue pill, kind of scenario.  If
you only came here to learn the teensy, tiniest, smallest set of commands you'll
need to use Vim, then we may as well get this over with. Yours is the blue pill.
 
     0) At a terminal you'd type "vim FILENAME" to open up a file in Vim.
     1) Press "i". Now you can type.
     2) Use the arrow keys to move around. Backspace and delete as usual.
     3) When you're done hit [ESC]. The word "INSERT" will disappear.
     4) To save the file and quit type ":wq" and hit ENTER.  To quit without
     saving type ":q!" and hit ENTER.
 
For those choosing red, well at least you know some super basics about getting
in, editing, and getting out of Vim. Now hit [ESC], type ":o second.html",
(don't worry about typing at the bottom of the screen for now), breathe deeply,
and hit ENTER.
