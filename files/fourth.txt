Think of Normal mode as a giant sheet of perfectly transparent ice that has
frozen over top of all the words in your document. You skate gracefully over
this ice with "hjkl" movements.  Whenever you need to type something just triple
toe loop over to where you want using the "hjkl" keys, then press "i" and begin
furiously typing away.  When you're done, hit [ESC], and you'll surface from the
depths of your deep blue document which will immediately freeze over again so
you can use your favorite keys, "hjkl".

Let's review:

1) To get into your document you type (from the command line) "vim FILENAME".
   Since this is all in the browser, we haven't actually had to do that,
   which is why I want to mention it here.

2) To move the cursor up and down it's "j" like a hook sinking down and "k" like
   K2, pointing up.  To move left and right it's the two keys to the left and
   right of "jk", these are "h" and "l".

   (there's more text below this; 60 lines in total -- hold "j" to scroll down)

3) To get back into Normal mode, where everything is frozen and you just skate
   on top of it, hit [ESC].  If you're already in Normal mode hitting [ESC]
   won't hurt you, you'll just stay in that mode.

4) Getting out of Vim was covered briefly at the start, but it really deserves
   more discussion.  There's another mode we haven't covered yet, and that's
   "Execute" mode.  You can get to Execute mode from Normal mode by typing
   ":" -- a colon.  The cursor will move to the bottom of the screen.  Now
   you can type a command.  In most programs Ctrl+S is the shortcut for "save".
   In Vim it's ":w".  To quit, type ":q".  If you're trying to quit and haven't
   saved a modified file, Vim won't let you just leave without being more
   explicit.  Here you have two options:

     ":wq"  This says, "write and quit."
     ":q!"  This says, "Just quit, I don't want to save!"

   There are many other things you could type after the colon, but these
   two, ":wq" and ":q!" are the two you'll use 99% time.  The other one
   you've been using is ":o" which stands for "open" if you haven't figured
   that out. If you're feeling adventurous try ":colorscheme hicon.

A new finite state machine is in order:

        +--------+   "i"    +--------+
        |        |--------> |        |
        | Normal |          | Insert |
        |        | <--------|        |
        +--------+   [ESC]  +--------+
          |    ^
          |    |
      ":" |    | [ESC]   You can remember Execute mode because the two dots
          |    |         of the colon kind of look like the two sides of the
          V    |         coin that Twoface (from Batman?) always flips when
       +---------+       deciding whether or not to kill (i.e., execute)
       |         |       someone.  Macabre, I know, but now you'll remember.
       | Execute |
       |         |       Type ":o fifth.html" when you think you've had your
       +---------+       fill of this crazy-awesome ASCII art.
