\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Let $M$ be a Turing machine with two halting states, $y$ and $n$,
that does not decide a language.  Since $y$ and $n$ are the only two
halting states, we know that if $M$ halted for some input $w$ then
it would either be accepting or rejecting $w$.  To ensure that there are
some inputs $w$ in the universe of all possible inputs that \emph{cannot}
be decided by $M$ we must ensure that $M$ does not halt on all inputs.
The simplest way to do this of course it to define $M$ such that it never
halts at all.  $M = (K, \Sigma, \delta, s, H)$ where

\begin{eqnarray*}
K \EQ \{q, y, n\} \\
\Sigma \EQ \{\sqcup, \rhd\}\cup\{\text{ an alphabet }\} \\
s \EQ q \\
H \EQ \{y, n\} \\
\delta \EQ \{(q,\alpha), (q,\alpha)\} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{enumerate}
