SEARCH ONLY
-----------
For a simple search just type "/word_i_want_to_find".  The slash will put your
cursor down below, kind of like Execute mode, except it's not.  Hit ENTER and
Vim will put the cursor at the next occurrence of whatever word you were
searching for.  If you were to type "i" from here you'd start Inserting at that
point.  Try typing "/the" then press ENTER.  Cool, huh?

If you want to find the next occurrence, just start hitting "n" (for "next") and
the cursor will jump around to each occurence of the word.  "Search" isn't
really it's own separate mode in Vim but I'm going to make this finite state
machine anyway just to provide some idea of what's going on.  You'll figure it
out soon enough.

        +--------+   "/"    . . . . . . 
        |        |--------> .         .-----+
        | Normal |          . Search  .     | "n" Find the next occurence.
        |        | <--------.         . <---+
        +--------+   [ESC]  . . . . . .

              (there are more lines after this, 50 in all)

SEARCH AND REPLACE
------------------
Ah yes, ye olde search-and-replace. This piece of functionality has been around
ever since people started doing things one way for a really long time only to
realize they actually wanted to do it differently. Ever done that? Let's not go
crazy here (there are many variations), I'm just going to give you the command
that I use 99% of the time and I'm sure you'll take it from there. Here she is:

              :%s/old_term/new_term/gc     Try :%s/the/TTTHHHEEE/gc
              ||  |        |        ||
              ||  |        |        ||
              ||  what     |        ||
              ||  you are  |        |+----+
              ||  looking  |        |     |
              ||  for     what      |     |
              ||         you are    | "confirm" means 
         +----+|        replacing   | ask before each replace
         |     +--+      it with    |
         |        |             "global"
         |    "%s" means        means do
         |    search the        this for
         |    whole dang    all occurences
         |     document
      Execute
        mode

That's it! We've covered the basics of Normal, Insert, Execute, Search and
Search-and-Replace. Other modes real Vim has that have been left out include
Visual, Visual-Block, and Command-Line, but you'll look those up later,
right? The only modes I have partially implemented here and not mentioned at
all are Replace ("R") and Visual-Line ("V").
