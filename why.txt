Why you should know Vim:

 * It is available on all major Linux distributions as well as Mac OS X.
 * It employs a text-based user interface.  This means it requires no
   graphical environment, just access to a terminal.  Especially useful and
   sometimes necessary when SSHing into a remote machine.
 * It is the well-established Swiss Army knife of UNIX-based systems.
 * Your dad knew Vim.
 * It is a chick magnet.
 * It is a man tractor beam.
 * People will respect you more.
 * Vim is free and open source software.
 * You need to pick a side in the Vim versus Emacs religious wars, and Vim is
   the right side.  (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war.)
