knowvim.com is a place to learn and familiarize yourself with Vim, text editor
of the gods. More than a Vim tutorial, knowvim provides a partial Javascript
implementation of Vim* so that you can try it right in your browser. You're
looking at it now.

Some background if you're lost: programmers spend tons of time in source code,
using any one of many available text editors for the typing and tweaking of
program code. Whether you're on Linux, Mac OS, or Windows, you've got some
choices for editors, some available in every OS and some not: Nano, Emacs,
Gedit, Vim, Eclipse, and TextMate come to mind, among others. If you're looking
for one to rule them all, consider Vim. Every editor (and IDE) has its strong
suit, and Vim is not always the best tool for the job, but sometimes, it is. And
often, it can come pretty darn close, if you know how to use it.

Use the links above to read stuff like, "why Vim?", and where to start if you're
a n00b. The python, latex, and java files are there for experimenting with the
kind of code you might actually use in the real world (and by "real world" I
mean "college courses").

(*) I say "partial" because it implements just a subset of Vim functionality.
