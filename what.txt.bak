Welcome to knowvim.com, a place where you'll be introduced to Vim, text editor
of the gods. If you're a programmer and have heard of Vim before, you know why
you're here.  If you have no idea what's going on, here's the deal: programmers
spend tons of time in source code; writing, removing and tweaking what is
ultimately just a bunch of text.  They do all this with (no surprise) a text
editor; a program that is used on a daily basis for the grunt work of coding and
system administration.

If you're on a Linux or Mac system you've got some choices for text editors,
some available in both and some not: Nano, Emacs, Gedit, Vim, Eclipse, and
TextMate, among others.  (As an aside, if you're on Windows, your life still
sucks, but there is hope to be found in gvim. See the "links" page.)  If you
desire greatness, have a willingness to learn, are patient, and know what's good
for you, you have one choice, and that is Vim.  You really should know Vim.

Use the links above to read stuff like, "why Vim?", where to start if you're a
n00b, and advanced material for advanced individuals.  The python, latex, and
java files are there for experimenting with the kind of code you might actually
use in the real world (and by "real world" I mean "college courses").
