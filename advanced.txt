Glad to see you here. The "start" section covered a really tiny set of commands
to get people started with Vim. Here, I'll talk about some other commands I
personally find quite useful. If you're feeling information overload setting in
after going through the "start" section don't sweat it; stick with those simple
commands and come back later when you want to get faster. Note: these commands
are all done within Normal mode.

TL;DR: Look at this table.

Command | Action                     | How you'll remember this
--------+----------------------------+------------------------------------------
 .      | Repeat last command        | No idea, it's just awesome. Try "dd" then
        |                            | press and hold "."
        |                            |
--------+----------------------------+------------------------------------------
        |                            |
 w      | Move to next word          | "w" stands for "word."
 b      | Move to previous word      | Go (b)ack one word.
 0      | Move to beginning of line  | Zero is the beginning of everything.
 $      | Move to the end of line    | If you've used regular expressions this
        |                            | makes sense. If not, then how about
        |                            | "Money doesn't matter in the END" (?)
 }      | Move to next paragraph     | Imagine drawing one of those beautiful
        |                            | curly braces around each paragraph in
        |                            | your text.
 {      | Move to previous paragraph | It's the opposite of "}".
 gg     | Move to very top line      | Pictures the two g's as a couple of
        |                            | balloons floating up into the sky. I
        |                            | know, it's dumb.
 G      | Move to very last line     | Contrast "G" with "gg"; "G" is like a
        |                            | humongous heavy cinder block falling to
        |                            | the bottom of the ocean.
        |                            |
--------+----------------------------+------------------------------------------
        |                            |
 dd     | Delete current line        | "How (d)o I (d)elete a line?"
 D      | Delete rest of line        | Imagine the "D" as a giant mouth about to
        |                            | eat the rest of the line.  Nom.
 x      | Delete character           | Imagine the "x" as a crosshairs that
        |                            | appears right before you zap a character
        |                            | out of existence.
 dw     | Delete word                | (d)elete the next (w)ord.
        |                            |
 dgg    | Delete to top              | 
 dG     | Delete to bottom           | 
 cw     | Delete word and INSERT     | The "c" stands for "change"
 C      | Delete to end and INSERT   | It's just like D but with INSERT
 r[x]   | Replace single             |
 R      | REPLACE mode               | It's pretty obvious what the giant
        |                            | capital "R" stands for.
 s      | Delete char and INSERT     | No idea how you'll remember this,
        |                            | you just will.
 S      | Erase line and INSERT      | Same as above.
 ~      | Toggle case                | Again, no idea how you'll remember this
--------+----------------------------+------------------------------------------
        |                            |
 yy     | Copy the current line      | "y" stands for "yank." I guess imagine
        | to "clipboard"             | that lines don't "want" to be copied to
        |                            | the clipboard, so you must "yank" them.
 p      | Paste clipboard contents   | "p" stands for "paste."
        | into line below

 Note: Just so we're clear, Vim does not really use ridiculous mainstream
       metaphors like "clipboard" when speaking of "copying and pasting"
       lines of text (it uses "registers," because those sound infinitely
       more serious and hardcore).  Nonetheless, when starting out you can
       think of "yy" and "p" this way.

        |                            |
--------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------
        |                            |
 i      | Enter Insert               | "i" stands for "Insert."
 I      | Enter Insert at very       | Capital "I" is like "i" on steroids.
        | beginning of line.         |
 a      | Enter Insert AFTER the     | "a" stands for "after."
        | cursor                     |
 A      | Enter Insert at very end   | Capital "A" is like "a" on steroids.
        | of line                    |
