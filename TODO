[ ] Positioning. Figure out how the column position is determined after
 |  vertical movements and especially characterwise yanks and such. Maybe
 |  create a Positioning.js module with methods like
 |
 |  var col = getColumnPosition({
 |      startCol : Number
 |      motionResult : {
 |          motionName : String,
 |          type : 'characterwise' | 'linewise',
 |          inclusive : Boolean
 |          ...
 |      }
 |  });

Bugs
----
[ ] Change empty lines to blank spaces only when the cursor is over them.
    When the cursor leaves, change the line contents back to the empty
    string (currently they are left as a single space). To reproduce edit a
    file with a blank line. "j" movement down to the line, then "k" away
    from it. Line contents will remain a single space, even after "k"-ing
    away.
