Features
--------
[ ] INSERT mode
[ ] Update mark positions for every delete and insertion.

[ ] Positioning. Figure out how the column position is determined after
    vertical movements and especially characterwise yanks and such. Maybe
    create a Positioning.js module with methods like
  
    var col = getColumnPosition({
        startCol : Number
        motionResult : {
            motionName : String,
            type : 'characterwise' | 'linewise',
            inclusive : Boolean
            ...
        }
    });
[ ] w motion
[ ] b motion
[ ] } motion
[ ] { motion
[ ] gg motion
[ ] G motion

[ ] f motion
[ ] F motion
[ ] t motion
[ ] T motion

[ ] / forward search
[ ] ? backward search
[ ] n motion
[ ] N motion
[X] Deletes
[X] Puts

Code Maintenance
----------------
[ ] Create map of error codes and messages (e.g., E20 => Mark not set)
[ ] Remove Positioning module since its only used in one spot.

Bugs
----
[ ] Change empty lines to blank spaces only when the cursor is over them.
    When the cursor leaves, change the line contents back to the empty
    string (currently they are left as a single space). To reproduce edit a
    file with a blank line. "j" movement down to the line, then "k" away
    from it. Line contents will remain a single space, even after "k"-ing
    away.

[X] Sometimes {count} values get mixed up. To reproduce:
        y4j => Yanks 5 lines (expected)
        4yj => Yanks 5 lines in register r (expected)
        "ry4j => Yanks 5 lines in register r (expected)
        "r4yj => Yanks 17 lines into register r (unexpected)
