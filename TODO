Implement better search and replace commands. E.g., :s/old/new, %s/old/new
without g and c options.

fix bug in 'gqj' command.  To repeat:
 :colorscheme hicon
 gqj
. (repeatedly)

fix bug where hitting SPACE key moves page when writeoutput panel is long.

refactor code so that v_cursor_move does not always need to be followed by
calls to set_line_visibilities and renumber_lines(start).
