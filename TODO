[ ] Positioning. Figure out how the column position is determined after
    vertical movements and especially characterwise yanks and such. Maybe
    create a Positioning.js module with methods like

    var col = getColumnPosition({
        startCol : Number
        motionResult : {
            motionName : String,
            type : 'characterwise' | 'linewise',
            inclusive : Boolean
            ...
        }
    });
