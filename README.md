=======

A Vim web demo.  http://knowvim.com aims to provide a friendly introduction
to beginners fresh off their first Google searches on the subject.  It
doesn't even come close to having all the behavior of real Vim.  Its
underlying is non-existant; there is no framework whatsoever and most of the
Javascript is hopelessly entangled (strangled?) with the markup it is
intended to manipulate.  In short, there is much room for improvement.
