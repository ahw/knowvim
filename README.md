A Vim web demo.  http://knowvim.com aims to provide a friendly introduction to beginners fresh off their first Google
searches on the subject.  It doesn't even come close to having all the behavior of real Vim.  It's underlying
is non-existant; there is no framework whatsoever and most of the Javascript is hopelessly entangled with the markup it
is intended to manipulate.  In short, there is much room for improvement.
