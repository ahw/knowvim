knowvim
=======

A Vim web demo.  http://knowvim.com aims to provide a friendly introduction
to beginners fresh off their first Google searches on the subject.  It
doesn't even come close to having all the behavior of real Vim.
Unfortunately, there is no real framework underyling the code and its
Javascript is hopelessly entangled (strangled?) with the markup it is
intended to manipulate.  The `master` branch contains the code as
it exists on http://knowvim.com today, and the `refactor` branch
contains the first tiny steps I have taken to bring order to things and
introduce BackboneJS. This is a work in progress and there is much room for
improvement.
