knowvim
=======

A Vim web demo.  http://knowvim.com aims to provide a friendly introduction
to beginners fresh off their first Google searches on the subject.  It
doesn't even come close to having all the behavior of real Vim. I am in the
process of refactoring a lot of this code, and there is still much room for
improvement. It is not yet in a releaseable state; the code running on
http://knowvim.com is still all old. I have a development site,
http://dev.knowvim.com which is running on the `master` branch of this
repository.
